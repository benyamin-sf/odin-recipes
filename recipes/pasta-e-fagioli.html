    <h2>Tip &amp; tricks</h2>

    <blockquote>"This entire recipe is cheaper than one bowl at Olive Garden!"</blockquote>
    <p>
        culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) says of this pasta fagioli recipe. Here are a few of
        her best tips and tricks for making a perfect pot of Italian soup every time:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Though the recipe calls for one can of chicken broth, Nicole uses more because she prefers her pasta fagioli
            a
            little more soupy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Many of the pasta fagioli recipes call for Italian sausage. You can add the meat if you like, but this
            top-rated
            recipe is pretty hearty as-is.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, Nicole likes to ladle the soup into bowls and top with freshly grated Parmesan, cracked black
            pepper, and fresh parsley.
        </li>
    </ul>
